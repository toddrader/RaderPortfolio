    	<p>I was in a movie with Al Pacino. He was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1132623/">'Dr. Death'</a> Jack Kevorkian. I was a photographer. I played a <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261391/">Chicago cop</a> on TV. In the mob movie, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1416801/">'Kill the Irishman',</a> Vincent D'Onofrio and I, and 200 other guys, were dockworkers.
    	</p>
    	<p>At work and at play, I take on many roles to support team. I am a strategic and creative marketer who gets it and gets it done.
    	</p>
    	<p>As an Engagement Strategist and Project Manager, I see projects through the eyes and experiences of customers. I connect all the dots in their journey – planning a course from where they are to where we’d like them to go – from quality of life insight to the desired result. Part UX architect, part media surveyor, part content manager, part go-to-market planner, part PM, I manage to make it all work, while usually wearing a vintage bowling shirt with another guy’s name on it.
    	</p>
    	<p>I have enjoyed roles on all three sides of the ball: client, agency and production. My experiences provide a deeper understanding and achieve greater results.
    	</p>
    	<p>I was recognized as Employee of the Year at Campbell Ewald for innovations in workflow and technology while managing a team of 22 direct reports.
